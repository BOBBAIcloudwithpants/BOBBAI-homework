# 算法与伪代码

Part 1:回答问题    
1）用伪代码描述将十进制转换成16进制的方法    
2）C语言实现（先用注释写好算法，然后翻译）    
3）使用 -1, 0, 1, 15, 26，3265 最为输入测试你的程序

1)Pseudocode:    

```
if the given decimal number doesn't equal 0,repeat the following operation:
declare a variable that save the value of input%16; 
declare a variable that count the times of operation,assigned as 0;   
Judge whether this variable is a value between 0 and 9;
    if is :
        regard this value(0-9) as a bit of the oucome depending on the total times;
    if not:
        than regard the chars,from A to F,which matches 10 to 15,as a bit of the outcome depending on the total times;    
    Now replace the origin value as origins/16;    
    Meanwhile plus 1 to the variable counting times;
```
2)C语言实现    
```
#include <stdio.h>

int input; //declare the input;
scanf("%d",&input);
if(input<0)
    {input=-input;
    putchar('-');
while(input){
    int left;//declare the mod
    left=input%16;
    char outcome[999];
    int times=0;//declare the variable that count times;
    if(left>=0&&left<=9){
        outcome[times++]=left+'0';
    }
    else{
        outcome[times++]=(char)(left+55)
    }
    input/=16;
}

int i;//output the outcome;

for(i=0;i<times;i++){
    printf("%c",outcome[i]);
}   
```
3)结果测试：    
(-1)<sub>10</sub>==(-1)<sub>16</sub>    
(0)<sub>10</sub>==(0)<sub>16</sub>    
(1)<sub>10</sub>==(1)<sub>16</sub>    
(15)<sub>10</sub>==(F)<sub>16</sub>    
(-1)<sub>10</sub>==(-1)<sub>16</sub>    
(26)<sub>10</sub>==(1A)<sub>16</sub>     
(3265)<sub>10</sub>==(CC1)<sub>16</sub>    

## Part 2:名词解释    
1。**Top-down design**:A top-down approach (also known as stepwise design and in some cases used as a synonym of decomposition) is essentially the breaking down of a system to gain insight into its compositional sub-systems in a reverse engineering fashion. In a top-down approach an overview of the system is formulated, specifying, but not detailing, any first-level subsystems. Each subsystem is then refined in yet greater detail, sometimes in many additional subsystem levels, until the entire specification is reduced to base elements. A top-down model is often specified with the assistance of "black boxes", which makes it easier to manipulate. However, black boxes may fail to clarify elementary mechanisms or be detailed enough to realistically validate the model. Top down approach starts with the big picture. It breaks down from there into smaller segments.
>![Building blocks are an example of bottom-up design because the parts are first created and then assembled without regard to how the parts will work in the assembly.](https://upload.cc/i1/2018/11/08/lv97qy.jpg)
     
2.**Work breakdown structure**:A work-breakdown structure (WBS)[2] in project management and systems engineering, is a deliverable-oriented breakdown of a project into smaller components. A work breakdown structure is a key project deliverable that organizes the team's work into manageable sections. The Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK 5) defines the work-breakdown structure "A hierarchical decomposition of the total scope of work to be carried out by the project team to accomplish the project objectives and create the required deliverables."    
3.对比：    
In a top-down approach an overview of the system is formulated, specifying, but not detailing, any first-level subsystems.But hierarchical decomposition of the total scope of work to be carried out by the project team to accomplish the project objectives and create the required deliverables,which means the subpart needs a clear directions.    
Every subsystem in top-down approaches is more detailed than it in work-breakdown structure.
