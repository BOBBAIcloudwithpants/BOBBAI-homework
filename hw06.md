#Part 1:answer the following question    
1、According to the von Neumann architecture, List basic parts of a
computer.    
2、A computer has 64 MB (megabytes) of memory. How many bits are
needed to address any single byte in memory?    
3、List basic parts of a CPU, include cache or not?    
4、What mean secondary storage. List some on your PC. 

**The answers**
>1.According to the von Neumann architecture,the basic parts of a computer should include:**input device**,**Central Processing Unit** in which contains ALU and Control Unit,**Memory Unit**,**Output device** and **Auxiliary storage device**.     
2.The memory address is 64MB.This means you need log<sub>2</sub>2<sup>26</sup>,or 26 bits to address any single byte in memory.    
3.A CPU has two basic parts :ALU,and Control unit.Don't include cache.    
4.Auxiliary memory, also known as auxiliary storage, secondary storage, secondary memory or external memory, is a non-volatile memory (does not lose stored data when the device is powered down) that is not directly accessible by the CPU, because it is not accessed via the input/output channels (it is an external device). In RAM devices (as flash memory) data can be directly deleted or changed.For examples,on my PC,Solid-state drive,SSD is the secondary storage.
     
#Part 2:The concepts'explanation     
1.**CPU**:A central processing unit (CPU) is the electronic circuitry within a computer that carries out the instructions of a computer program by performing the basic arithmetic, logical, control and input/output (I/O) operations specified by the instructions. The computer industry has used the term "central processing unit" at least since the early 1960s.[1] Traditionally, the term "CPU" refers to a processor, more specifically to its processing unit and control unit (CU), distinguishing these core elements of a computer from external components such as main memory and I/O circuitry.

2.**RAM**:Random-access memory (RAM /ræm/) is a form of computer data storage that stores data and machine code currently being used. A random-access memory device allows data items to be read or written in almost the same amount of time irrespective of the physical location of data inside the memory. In contrast, with other direct-access data storage media such as hard disks, CD-RWs, DVD-RWs and the older magnetic tapes and drum memory, the time required to read and write data items varies significantly depending on their physical locations on the recording medium, due to mechanical limitations such as media rotation speeds and arm movement.    
    
3.**ROM**:Read-only memory (ROM) is a type of non-volatile memory used in computers and other electronic devices. Data stored in ROM can only be modified slowly, with difficulty, or not at all, so it is mainly used to store firmware (software that is closely tied to specific hardware, and unlikely to need frequent updates) or application software in plug-in cartridges.

4.**Bus(computing)**:In computer architecture, a bus[1] (a contraction of the Latin omnibus) is a communication system that transfers data between components inside a computer, or between computers. This expression covers all related hardware components (wire, optical fiber, etc.) and software, including communication protocols.

5.**Parallel computing**:
Parallel computing is a type of computation in which many calculations or the execution of processes are carried out simultaneously. Large problems can often be divided into smaller ones, which can then be solved at the same time. There are several different forms of parallel computing: bit-level, instruction-level, data, and task parallelism. Parallelism has long been employed in high-performance computing, but it's gaining broader interest due to the physical constraints preventing frequency scaling. As power consumption (and consequently heat generation) by computers has become a concern in recent years,[3] parallel computing has become the dominant paradigm in computer architecture, mainly in the form of multi-core processors.

#Part 3:实际应用    
问题：7、小孙买了计算机主板，说明书表明“支持双通道DDR3-1333内存，
最大支持16G”    
1）DDR3内存，“3”和“1333”的含义是什么？    
2）小孙买8G DDR3-1600的内存能提高性能吗？    
3）小孙买4G*2 DDR3-1333的内存能提高性能吗？    
4）16G需要多少位地址？    
解答：
>1) "3"表示第三代，“1333”表示它的数据速率为1333（MT/S）    
2）    不可以    
3）    可以
4）需要34位地址。
