#INFORMATION
**Information** is any entity or form that provides the answer to a question of some kind or resolves uncertainty.
_It thus related to_:1.Data;2.Knowledge
As it regards data, the information's existence is not necessarily coupled to an observer (it exists beyond an event horizon, for example), while in the case of knowledge, the information requires a cognitive observer.
*For example
>![Look at this picture.Information embedded in an abstract mathematical object with symmetry breaking nucleus.To unfold these information from this simple picture,a observer must possess incredible reservoir related to this extend and that is what we called a cognitive observer](https://upload.cc/i1/2018/09/28/LUDdlR.jpg)

#POSITIONAL NOTATION
**Positional notation** or place-value notation is a method of representing or encoding numbers. 
_It's paculiarity_:Positional notation is distinguished from other notations (such as Roman numerals) for its use of the same symbol for the different orders of magnitude (for example, the "ones place", "tens place", "hundreds place"). 
_Advantages_:greatly simplified arithmetic, leading to the rapid spread of the notation across the world.

#ALGORITHM
**Algorithm**is an unambiguous specification of how to solve a class of problems. Algorithms can perform calculation, data processing and automated reasoning tasks.
_Algorithm's history_:The concept of algorithm has existed for centuries and the use of the concept can be ascribed to Greek mathematicians, e.g. the sieve of Eratosthenes and Euclid's algorithm;[8] the term algorithm itself derives from the 9th Century mathematician Muḥammad ibn Mūsā al'Khwārizmī, latinized 'Algoritmi'. A partial formalization of what would become the modern notion of algorithm began with attempts to solve the Entscheidungsproblem (the "decision problem") posed by David Hilbert in 1928. Subsequent formalizations were framed as attempts to define "effective calculability"[9] or "effective method";[10] those formalizations included the Gödel–Herbrand–Kleene recursive functions of 1930, 1934 and 1935, Alonzo Church's lambda calculus of 1936, Emil Post's Formulation 1 of 1936, and Alan Turing's Turing machines of 1936–7 and 1939.
>![Flowchart of an algorithm (Euclid's algorithm) for calculating the greatest common divisor (g.c.d.) of two numbers a and b in locations named A and B. The algorithm proceeds by successive subtractions in two loops: IF the test B ≥ A yields "yes" (or true) (more accurately the number b in location B is greater than or equal to the number a in location A) THEN, the algorithm specifies B ← B − A (meaning the number b − a replaces the old b). Similarly, IF A > B, THEN A ← A − B. The process terminates when (the contents of) B is 0, yielding the g.c.d. in A. (Algorithm derived from Scott 2009:13; symbols and drawing style from Tausworthe 1977).](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm#/media/File:Euclid_flowchart.svg)

#SOFTWARE BUG
**Software bug** is an error, flaw, failure or fault in a computer program or system that causes it to produce an incorrect or unexpected result, or to behave in unintended ways.The process of fixing bugs is termed "debugging" and often uses formal techniques or tools to pinpoint bugs, and since the 1950s, some computer systems have been designed to also deter, detect or auto-correct various computer bugs during operations.

When it comes to the positional notation ,in Chinese what we called“进制”，contains four popular kinds.They are:"十进制“in Chinese,and'decimalism'in English;
                            "二进制“in Chinese,and 'binary'in English;
                            "八进制“in Chinese,and 'octonary'in English;
                            "十六进制“in Chinese,and 'hexadecimal'in English.
