#First part:concepts explanation.  

**Method of complements**  
  In mathematics and computing, the method of complements is a technique used to subtract one number from another using only addition of positive numbers. This method was commonly used in mechanical calculators and is still used in modern computers.
  >![Complement numbers on an adding machine c. 1910. The smaller numbers, for use when subtracting, are the nines' complement of the larger numbers, which are used when adding.](https://upload.cc/i1/2018/09/29/SvHRuV.jpg)

**Byte**  
The byte is a unit of digital information that most commonly consists of eight bits, representing a binary number. Historically, the byte was the number of bits used to encode a single character of text in a computer[1][2] and for this reason it is the smallest addressable unit of memory in many computer architectures.    

**Integer(computer science)**    
In computer science, an integer is a datum of integral data type, a data type that represents some range of mathematical integers. Integral data types may be of different sizes and may or may not be allowed to contain negative values. Integers are commonly represented in a computer as a group of binary digits (bits). The size of the grouping varies so the set of integer sizes available varies between different types of computers. Computer hardware, including virtual machines, nearly always provide a way to represent a processor register or memory address as an integer.    

**Floating-point arithmetic**    
In computing, floating-point arithmetic (FP) is arithmetic using formulaic representation of real numbers as an approximation so as to support a trade-off between range and precision. For this reason, floating-point computation is often found in systems which include very small and very large real numbers, which require fast processing times.

#Second part:证明二进制的负数（two‘s complement of X）等于 X 的 ones’complement   
证明：

#Int8_t x = - 017,用八进制描述变量x    
>（-017）<sub>8 = (11110001)<sub>2    
(11110001)<sub>2 = (361)<sub>8    

#int8_t x = -0x1f; int y = x; 请用16进制描述变量 x 和 y，并说明 inty = x 的计算过程。    
>(1f)<sub>16</sub> = (00011111)<sub>2</sub>    
so:(-1f)<sub>16</sub> = (11100001)<sub>2</sub>    
(11100001)<sub>2</sub> = （e1）<sub>16</sub>    

>由已知得：y为32位或64位有符号数，在x，即(11100001)<sub>2</sub>的前面添加等于符号位的数即可。    
不妨设32位，则表示为：  
（11111111111111111111111111100001）<sub>2</sub>



#About NaN;    
**NaN**,in computing,standing for not a number, is a numeric data type value representing an undefined or unrepresentable value, especially in floating-point calculations. Systematic use of NaNs was introduced by the [IEEE 754](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754) floating-point standard in 1985, along with the representation of other non-finite quantities like infinities.    
>换句话说，NaN指的是在计算机语言中的一种数据类型，专门表示未定义或者无法表示的数据，特别是在浮点数的运算中。IEEE 754公布了一系列浮点数运算中出现问题的标准使用了NaN这一类型。
